name: "Teaching computer to repeat something specific"
description: "Computers are machines that do not know how to do anything until we train them. In this step we will tell it to say something specific everytime we start it"
instructor_guides:
  - "Ask a kid to act as a robot and only do what you tell him to do"
  - "Instructor uses the phrase `Say, My name is Jawad`"
  - "Hopefully the student says `My name is Jawad` as per your instructions. If not then guide him to repeat only the part you instructed to say"
  - "Create analogy that using the word `Say` is like telling a computer to repeat the required part"
  - "Once the analogy is explained then explain that in Python the use of `print(\"\")` is like using `Say`"
  - "Open any IDE like https://www.online-python.com/ to show case how it behaves by using code `print(\"My name is Jawad\")"
  - "Give a few more examples and then print a triangle using asterik"
