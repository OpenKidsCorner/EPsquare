name: "Teaching computer to have a pre-defined conversation"
description: "Previously, we learned how to insruct computer to repeat some phrase. However, one-way communication typically does not serve any purpose. Let us see how we can tell computer to listen to us too."
instructor_guides:
  - "Again ask a kid to act as a robot. This time the robot has to say something and wait for a response before saying the next thing"
  - |
    "Instructor will tell the robot student to
     - Say 'Hello' when someone says 'Computer turn on'. Then the robotic student waits for a response.
     - Next say 'What is your name', then wait for a response.
     - Next say 'Nice to meet you', then wait for a response.
     - Turn off"

    "After explaining the above instructions, ask another student to act as a user of the robot and do the following:
      - Say `computer turn on`
      - Say `Hello` in response to the robot's Hello
      - Say `My name is ....` in response to the robot's What is your name
      - Say `Nice to meet you too` and end the conversation"
  - "Repeat the same steps with another student"
  - "Once the concept of repeating a statement and waiting for an input is established. Then highlight that we can tell computer to wait for a response using 'input(\"\")'"
  - "Use the below code sample to explain it to the students. Once you run the code, you will type the statements the regular student performed"
